# Nova-Hub

* What all the files do.
  * settings.py - Where you can make changes to the app like example the url to take the user to if he clicks on the nova universe logo.
  * nova_hub.py - This python file is bascally the ring around the app.py. It's what checks for Nova Hub updates; manages them and also repairs the app if there's any missing files.
  * app.py - This is the gui app itself. This is usually ran by the nova_hub.py file.
